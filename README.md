# OpenGL Snow Simulation Playground

A snow simulator developed using OpenGL. This was built as a final project in CS 1230 (Computer Graphics) at Brown University. Read more about the course and the projects [here](https://cs1230.graphics).

The project provides a versatile environment for exploring and simulating snowfall in real-time. It offers various interactive controls and features, including wind speed and direction adjustment, lighting position manipulation, snow particle rate configuration, camera movement using W, A, S, D, and arrow keys, snow accumulation simulation, texture mapping, and support for different scenes.

NOTE: This is a placeholder repo with no code to respect Brown's Academic Code. If you are a potential employer and would like to look at the code, please send me an email.
